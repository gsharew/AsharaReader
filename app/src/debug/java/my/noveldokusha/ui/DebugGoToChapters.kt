This is a world of science fantasy where the older generations step back and allow the young to take charge of affairs. Heart-wrenching separations, terrifying situations, all with comic relief that will leave you coming back for more. This is a world where the other characters actually matter, and are revisited frequently as their own lives unfold. Dotting Lu Yinâ€™s path are monumental feats of kingdom-building and treacherous political situations where he must tread carefully if he wants to get to the truth of his history."
